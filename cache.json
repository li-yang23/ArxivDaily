In\ncontrast, language models (LMs) autoregressively synthesize programs in a\nsingle pass. One explanation for this is the scarcity of sequential edit data.\nWhile high-quality instruction data for code synthesis is scarce, edit data for\nsynthesis is even scarcer. To fill this gap, we develop a synthetic data\ngeneration algorithm called LintSeq. This algorithm refactors programs into\nsequences of synthetic edits by using a linter to procedurally sample across\ninterdependent lines of source code. Synthetic edits sampled with LintSeq\nreflect the syntax and semantics of their programming language. To test the\nalgorithm, we use it to refactor a dataset of instruction + program pairs into\ninstruction + program-diff-sequence tuples. Then, we fine-tune a series of\nsmaller LMs ranging from 2.6B to 14B parameters on both the re-factored and\noriginal versions of this dataset. We perform comprehensive evaluations\ncomparing edit sequence code LMs against baselines on HumanEval, MBPP(+),\nCodeContests, DS-1000, and BigCodeBench. We show that models fine-tuned to\niteratively synthesize code match or outperform baselines on pass@1, and\nexhibit better scaling across higher pass@k as a function of total test-time\nFLOPs.

Motivated by\nthis finding, we propose reparameterized absorbing discrete diffusion (RADD), a\ndedicated diffusion model without time-condition that characterizes the\ntime-independent conditional probabilities.

Unlike the\ntraditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal\nsamples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted\nreal-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have\nshown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However,\nthe reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of\ncorresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD &\nreasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset,\nAnomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through\ninvestigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o\ncannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images.\nTo address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first\nspecialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior\nin visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM)\nmechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over\nadvanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning.

These\nmethods aim to teach models to better distinguish between chosen (or preferred)\nand rejected (or dispreferred) responses. However, prior research has\nidentified that the probability of chosen responses often decreases during\ntraining, and this phenomenon is known as likelihood displacement. To tackle\nthis challenge, in this work we introduce \\method to controllably shift the\ndistribution of the chosen probability. Then, we show that \\method exhibits a\nfundamental trade-off between improving the chosen probability and sacrificing\nthe reward margin, as supported by both theoretical analysis and experimental\nvalidation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of \\method over DPO on\ndownstream tasks such as MT-Bench and a designed win rate experiment.

We start from the\npremise that humans and machines have differing concepts. This means\ninterpretability can be framed as a communication problem: humans must be able\nto reference and control machine concepts, and communicate human concepts to\nmachines. Creating a shared human-machine language through developing\nneologisms, we believe, could solve this communication problem. Successful\nneologisms achieve a useful amount of abstraction: not too detailed, so they're\nreusable in many contexts, and not too high-level, so they convey precise\ninformation. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how a \"length neologism\"\nenables controlling LLM response length, while a \"diversity neologism\" allows\nsampling more variable responses.

In this paper, we introduce LASP-2, a new SP method to enhance both\ncommunication and computation parallelism when training linear attention\ntransformer models with very-long input sequences. Compared to previous work\nLASP, LASP-2 rethinks the minimal communication requirement for SP on linear\nattention layers, reorganizes the whole communication-computation workflow of\nLASP. In this way, only one single AllGather collective communication is needed\non intermediate memory states, whose sizes are independent of the sequence\nlength, leading to significant improvements of both communication and\ncomputation parallelism, as well as their overlap.

Further,\nPolyrating can reduce the cost of human evaluations by up to $41\\%$ for new\nmodels and up to $77\\%$ for new tasks by leveraging existing benchmark scores.\nLastly, Polyrating enables direct comparisons of ratings across different\ntasks, providing a comprehensive understanding of an LLMs' strengths,\nweaknesses, and relative performance across different applications.\n","authors":["Jasper Dekoninck","Maximilian Baader","Martin Vechev"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00696v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04411v2","updated":"2025-02-11T12:09:51Z","published":"2025-02-06T11:26:30Z","title":"Mediator: Memory-efficient LLM Merging with Less Parameter Conflicts and\n  Uncertainty Based Routing","summary":"  Model merging aggregates Large Language Models (LLMs) finetuned on different\ntasks into a stronger one.

To address these challenges,\nthis paper introduces a lightweight span-based NER method called SeNER, which\nincorporates a bidirectional arrow attention mechanism coupled with\nLogN-Scaling on the [CLS] token to embed long texts effectively, and comprises\na novel bidirectional sliding-window plus-shaped attention (BiSPA) mechanism to\nreduce redundant candidate token-pair spans significantly and model\ninteractions between token-pair spans simultaneously. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art extraction accuracy on\nthree long NER datasets and is capable of extracting entities from long texts\nin a GPU-memory-friendly manner.

We propose a simple and general game-theoretic model to capture\nsuch scenarios. Our results on general games show that in a very broad class of\ngames, self-interested players benefit from letting their learning agents make\npayments to other learners during the game dynamics, and that in many cases,\nthis kind of behavior improves welfare for all players. Our results on first-\nand second-price auctions show that in equilibria of the ``payment policy\ngame,'' the agents' dynamics reach strong collusive outcomes with low revenue\nfor the auctioneer. These results raise new questions and highlight a challenge\nfor mechanism design in systems where automated learning agents can benefit\nfrom interacting with their peers in the digital ecosystem and outside the\nboundaries of the mechanism.\n","authors":["Yoav Kolumbus","Joe Halpern","Éva Tardos"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20880v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18768v3","updated":"2025-02-11T16:24:23Z","published":"2024-09-27T14:12:49Z","title":"Learning from Demonstration with Implicit Nonlinear Dynamics Models","summary":"  Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a useful paradigm for training policies\nthat solve tasks involving complex motions, such as those encountered in\nrobotic manipulation.

We start from the\npremise that humans and machines have differing concepts. This means\ninterpretability can be framed as a communication problem: humans must be able\nto reference and control machine concepts, and communicate human concepts to\nmachines. Creating a shared human-machine language through developing\nneologisms, we believe, could solve this communication problem. Successful\nneologisms achieve a useful amount of abstraction: not too detailed, so they're\nreusable in many contexts, and not too high-level, so they convey precise\ninformation. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how a \"length neologism\"\nenables controlling LLM response length, while a \"diversity neologism\" allows\nsampling more variable responses.

Firstly, we empirically\nshow that regulating the model capacity via Parameter-efficient fine-tuning\n(PEFT) mitigates memorization to some extent, however, it further requires the\nidentification of the exact parameter subsets to be fine-tuned for high-quality\ngeneration. To identify these subsets, we introduce a bi-level optimization\nframework, MemControl, that automates parameter selection using memorization\nand generation quality metrics as rewards during fine-tuning.

This viewpoint allows us to track the evolution of eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the matrix, which are governed by stochastic differential\nequations discovered by Dyson. These equations enable us to upper bound the\nFrobenius distance between the best rank-$k$ approximation of $M$ and that of a\nGaussian perturbation of $M$ as an integral that involves inverse eigenvalue\ngaps of the stochastically evolving matrix, as opposed to a sum of perturbation\nbounds obtained via Davis-Kahan-type theorems. Subsequently, again using the\nDyson Brownian motion viewpoint, we show that the eigenvalues of the matrix $M$\nperturbed by Gaussian noise have large gaps with high probability. These\nresults also contribute to the analysis of low-rank approximations under\naverage-case perturbations, and to an understanding of eigenvalue gaps for\nrandom matrices, both of which may be of independent interest.\n","authors":["Oren Mangoubi","Nisheeth K.

In this work, we narrow this gap by\nconducting the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agents in\nadversarial environments. First, we present a realistic threat model for\nattacks on the website, where we consider two adversarial targets: stealing\nusers' specific PII or the entire user request. Then, we propose a novel attack\nmethod, termed Environmental Injection Attack (EIA). EIA injects malicious\ncontent designed to adapt well to environments where the agents operate and our\nwork instantiates EIA specifically for privacy scenarios in web environments.\nWe collect 177 action steps that involve diverse PII categories on realistic\nwebsites from the Mind2Web, and conduct experiments using one of the most\ncapable generalist web agent frameworks to date. The results demonstrate that\nEIA achieves up to 70% ASR in stealing specific PII and 16% ASR for full user\nrequest. Additionally, by accessing the stealthiness and experimenting with a\ndefensive system prompt, we indicate that EIA is hard to detect and mitigate.\nNotably, attacks that are not well adapted for a webpage can be detected via\nhuman inspection, leading to our discussion about the trade-off between\nsecurity and autonomy.

Still, their computational intensity prohibits\nresource-constrained organizations from deploying T2I models after fine-tuning\nthem on their internal target data. While pruning techniques offer a potential\nsolution to reduce the computational burden of T2I models, static pruning\nmethods use the same pruned model for all input prompts, overlooking the\nvarying capacity requirements of different prompts. Dynamic pruning addresses\nthis issue by utilizing a separate sub-network for each prompt, but it prevents\nbatch parallelism on GPUs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Adaptive\nPrompt-Tailored Pruning (APTP), a novel prompt-based pruning method designed\nfor T2I diffusion models. Central to our approach is a prompt router model,\nwhich learns to determine the required capacity for an input text prompt and\nroutes it to an architecture code, given a total desired compute budget for\nprompts. Each architecture code represents a specialized model tailored to the\nprompts assigned to it, and the number of codes is a hyperparameter. We train\nthe prompt router and architecture codes using contrastive learning, ensuring\nthat similar prompts are mapped to nearby codes. Further, we employ optimal\ntransport to prevent the codes from collapsing into a single one.

Specifically, we define the covariance norm\nto enforce the smoothness of factor matrices in the global low-rank\nfactorization, and use structured covariance/kernel functions to model the\nlocal processes. For model estimation, we develop an alternating least squares\n(ALS) procedure with closed-form solutions for each subproblem. GLSKF utilizes\nzero-padding and slicing operations based on projection matrices which preserve\nthe Kronecker structure of covariances, facilitating efficient computations\nthrough the conjugate gradient (CG) method. The proposed framework is evaluated\non four real-world datasets across diverse tasks.

However,\nissues such as device malfunctions and network instability often cause sparse\ntrajectories, leading to lost detailed movement information. Recovering the\nmissing points in sparse trajectories to restore the detailed information is\nthus essential. Despite recent progress, several challenges remain. First, the\nlack of large-scale dense trajectory data makes it difficult to train a\ntrajectory recovery model from scratch. Second, the varying spatiotemporal\ncorrelations in sparse trajectories make it hard to generalize recovery across\ndifferent sampling intervals. Third, the lack of location information\ncomplicates the extraction of road conditions for missing points.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory recovery model\ncalled PLMTrajRec. It leverages the scalability of a pre-trained language model\n(PLM) and can be fine-tuned with only a limited set of dense trajectories. To\nhandle different sampling intervals in sparse trajectories, we first convert\neach trajectory's sampling interval and movement features into natural language\nrepresentations, allowing the PLM to recognize its interval. We then introduce\na trajectory encoder to unify trajectories of varying intervals into a single\ninterval and capture their spatiotemporal relationships. To obtain road\nconditions for missing points, we propose an area flow-guided implicit\ntrajectory prompt, which models road conditions by collecting traffic flows in\neach region. We also introduce a road condition passing mechanism that uses\nobserved points' road conditions to infer those of the missing points.\nExperiments on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals\neach demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and generalization ability of\nPLMTrajRec.\n","authors":["Tonglong Wei","Yan Lin","Youfang Lin","Shengnan Guo","Jilin Hu","Haitao Yuan","Gao Cong","Huaiyu Wan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14281v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01567v2","updated":"2025-02-11T13:27:59Z","published":"2024-05-24T18:39:20Z","title":"MeMo: Meaningful, Modular Controllers via Noise Injection","summary":"  Robots are often built from standardized assemblies, (e.g. arms, legs, or\nfingers), but each robot must be trained from scratch to control all the\nactuators of all the parts together.

However, generating long and\ncorrect CoT trajectories is challenging. Recent studies have demonstrated that\nLooped Transformers possess remarkable length generalization capabilities, but\ntheir limited generality and adaptability prevent them from serving as an\nalternative to auto-regressive solutions. To better leverage the strengths of\nLooped Transformers, we propose RELAY (REasoning through Loop Alignment\niterativelY). Specifically, we align the steps of Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nreasoning with loop iterations and apply intermediate supervision during the\ntraining of Looped Transformers. This additional iteration-wise supervision not\nonly preserves the Looped Transformer's ability for length generalization but\nalso enables it to predict CoT reasoning steps for unseen data. Therefore, we\nleverage this Looped Transformer to generate accurate reasoning chains for\ncomplex problems that exceed the training length, which will then be used to\nfine-tune an auto-regressive model. We conduct extensive experiments, and the\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with significant\nimprovements in the performance of the auto-regressive model.

However, the limited labeled multimodal data\noften hinders embedding performance. Recent approaches have leveraged data\nsynthesis to address this problem, yet the quality of synthetic data remains a\ncritical bottleneck. In this work, we identify three criteria for high-quality\nsynthetic multimodal data. First, broad scope ensures that the generated data\ncovers diverse tasks and modalities, making it applicable to various downstream\nscenarios. Second, robust cross-modal alignment makes different modalities\nsemantically consistent. Third, high fidelity ensures that the synthetic data\nmaintains realistic details to enhance its reliability. Guided by these\nprinciples, we synthesize datasets that: (1) cover a wide range of tasks,\nmodality combinations, and languages, (2) are generated via a deep thinking\nprocess within a single pass of a multimodal large language model, and (3)\nincorporate real-world images with accurate and relevant texts, ensuring\nfidelity through self-evaluation and refinement.

Unraveling Prompt Extraction Threats in\n  Customized Large Language Models","summary":"  The drastic increase of large language models' (LLMs) parameters has led to a\nnew research direction of fine-tuning-free downstream customization by prompts,\ni.e., task descriptions. While these prompt-based services (e.g. OpenAI's GPTs)\nplay an important role in many businesses, there has emerged growing concerns\nabout the prompt leakage, which undermines the intellectual properties of these\nservices and causes downstream attacks. In this paper, we analyze the\nunderlying mechanism of prompt leakage, which we refer to as prompt\nmemorization, and develop corresponding defending strategies. By exploring the\nscaling laws in prompt extraction, we analyze key attributes that influence\nprompt extraction, including model sizes, prompt lengths, as well as the types\nof prompts. Then we propose two hypotheses that explain how LLMs expose their\nprompts. The first is attributed to the perplexity, i.e. the familiarity of\nLLMs to texts, whereas the second is based on the straightforward token\ntranslation path in attention matrices. To defend against such threats, we\ninvestigate whether alignments can undermine the extraction of prompts. We find\nthat current LLMs, even those with safety alignments like GPT-4, are highly\nvulnerable to prompt extraction attacks, even under the most straightforward\nuser attacks. Therefore, we put forward several defense strategies with the\ninspiration of our findings, which achieve 83.8\\% and 71.0\\% drop in the prompt\nextraction rate for Llama2-7B and GPT-3.5, respectively.

In this work,\nwe present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning\nprocess by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and\nknowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training\nsamples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved\ninformation, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved\ncontent.

These challenges stem primarily from\ntokenization constraints, despite the critical role of such operations in data\npreprocessing and code generation. Through systematic analysis, we derive two\nkey insights: (1) LLMs face significant difficulties in leveraging intrinsic\ntoken knowledge for character-level reasoning, and (2) atomized word structures\ncan substantially enhance LLMs' ability to process token-level structural\ninformation. Building on these insights, we propose Character-Level\nManipulation via Divide and Conquer, a novel approach designed to bridge the\ngap between token-level processing and character-level manipulation. Our method\ndecomposes complex operations into explicit character-level subtasks coupled\nwith controlled token reconstruction phases, leading to significant\nimprovements in accuracy.

The typical approach to\nfact-checking these atomic claims involves retrieving a fixed number of pieces\nof evidence, followed by a verification step.

S3FT\nleverages the existence of multiple valid responses to a query. By utilizing\nthe model's correct responses, S3FT reduces model specialization during the\nfine-tuning stage. S3FT first identifies the correct model responses from the\ntraining set by deploying an appropriate judge. Then, it fine-tunes the model\nusing the correct model responses and the gold response (or its paraphrase) for\nthe remaining samples. The effectiveness of S3FT is demonstrated through\nexperiments on mathematical reasoning, Python programming and reading\ncomprehension tasks. The results show that standard SFT can lead to an average\nperformance drop of up to $4.4$ on multiple benchmarks, such as MMLU and\nTruthfulQA.

LLMs are notoriously vulnerable to biases in their dataset,\nleading to issues such as toxicity. While domain-adaptive training has been\nemployed to mitigate these issues, these techniques often address all model\nparameters indiscriminately during the repair process, resulting in poor repair\nquality and reduced model versatility. In this paper, we introduce a novel\ndynamic slicing-based intent-aware LLM repair strategy, IRepair. This approach\nselectively targets the most error-prone sections of the model for repair.\nSpecifically, we propose dynamically slicing the model's most sensitive layers\nthat require immediate attention, concentrating repair efforts on those areas.\nThis method enables more effective repairs with potentially less impact on the\nmodel's overall performance by altering a smaller portion of the model. We\nevaluated our technique on three models from the GPT2 and GPT-Neo families,\nwith parameters ranging from 800M to 1.6B, in a toxicity mitigation setup. Our\nresults show that IRepair repairs errors 43.6% more effectively while causing\n46% less disruption to general performance compared to the closest baseline,\ndirect preference optimization. Our empirical analysis also reveals that errors\nare more concentrated in a smaller section of the model, with the top 20% of\nlayers exhibiting 773% more error density than the remaining 80\\%.

On one\nhand, unlike natural languages, graphs are non-linear and characterized by\ncomplex topological structures. On the other hand, many graphs lack textual\ndata, making it difficult to formulate language-based CoT prompting.

Specifically, we decompose the adaptation process for each downstream\ntask into a series of inference steps, with each step consisting of\nprompt-based inference, ``thought'' generation, and thought-conditioned prompt\nlearning. While the steps mimic CoT prompting in NLP, the exact mechanism\ndiffers significantly. Specifically, at each step, an input graph, along with a\nprompt, is first fed into a pre-trained graph encoder for prompt-based\ninference. We then aggregate the hidden layers of the encoder to construct a\n``thought'', which captures the working state of each node in the current step.\nConditioned on this thought, we learn a prompt specific to each node based on\nthe current state.

Thus, we propose\nGATEAU, a novel framework to address the unique challenge of long context\nalignment by identifying the influential samples enriched with long-range\ndependency relations. Specifically, GATEAU measures the long-range dependencies\nfrom two essential aspects: the difficulty of generating target responses due\nto the long-range dependencies, and the difficulty of understanding long inputs\ndue to such dependencies. Comprehensive experiments indicate that GATEAU\neffectively identifies influential samples and the model trained on these\nselected samples exhibits better instruction-following and long-context\nunderstanding capabilities.\n","authors":["Shuzheng Si","Haozhe Zhao","Gang Chen","Yunshui Li","Kangyang Luo","Chuancheng Lv","Kaikai An","Fanchao Qi","Baobao Chang","Maosong Sun"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15633v4.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07677v2","updated":"2025-02-12T03:31:45Z","published":"2025-02-11T16:27:28Z","title":"Auto-Drafting Police Reports from Noisy ASR Outputs: A Trust-Centered\n  LLM Approach","summary":"  Achieving a delicate balance between fostering trust in law en- forcement and\nprotecting the rights of both officers and civilians continues to emerge as a\npressing research and product challenge in the world today.

Our agents aim to maximize the expected growth rate of\ntheir wealth but have different theories on how to learn this best. We focus on\ncomparing Bayesian and no-regret learners in market dynamics. Bayesian learners\nwith a prior over a finite set of models that assign positive prior probability\nto the correct model have posterior probabilities that converge exponentially\nto the correct model. Consequently, they survive even in the presence of agents\nwho invest according to the correct model of the stochastic process. Bayesians\nwith a continuum prior converge to the correct model at a rate of $O((\\log\nT)/T)$. Online learning theory provides no-regret algorithms for maximizing the\nlog of wealth in this setting, achieving a worst-case regret bound of $O(\\log\nT)$ without assuming a steady underlying stochastic process but comparing to\nthe best fixed investment rule. This regret, as we observe, is of the same\norder of magnitude as that of a Bayesian learner with a continuum prior.\nHowever, we show that even such low regret may not be sufficient for survival\nin asset markets: an agent can have regret as low as $O(\\log T)$, but still\nvanish in market dynamics when competing against agents who invest according to\nthe correct model or even against a perfect Bayesian with a finite prior. On\nthe other hand, we show that Bayesian learning is fragile, while no-regret\nlearning requires less knowledge of the environment and is therefore more\nrobust. Any no-regret learner will drive out of the market an imperfect\nBayesian whose finite prior or update rule has even small errors.

The heterogeneity in data distribution frequently arises\nfrom spatial distribution of devices, leading to degraded model performance in\nthe absence of proper handling. Additionally, FL typical reliance on\ncentralized architectures introduces bottlenecks and single-point-of-failure\nrisks, particularly problematic at scale or in dynamic environments. To close\nthis gap, we propose Field-Based Federated Learning (FBFL), a novel approach\nleveraging macroprogramming and field coordination to address these limitations\nthrough: (i) distributed spatial-based leader election for personalization to\nmitigate non-IID data challenges; and (ii) construction of a self-organizing,\nhierarchical architecture using advanced macroprogramming patterns.

Recent advancements in 3D-based imitation learning have\nshown promising results, providing an effective pathway to achieve this goal.\nHowever, obtaining high-quality 3D representations presents two key problems:\n(1) the quality of point clouds captured by a single-view camera is\nsignificantly affected by factors such as camera resolution, positioning, and\nocclusions caused by the dexterous hand; (2) the global point clouds lack\ncrucial contact information and spatial correspondences, which are necessary\nfor fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks. To eliminate these limitations,\nwe propose CordViP, a novel framework that constructs and learns\ncorrespondences by leveraging the robust 6D pose estimation of objects and\nrobot proprioception. Specifically, we first introduce the interaction-aware\npoint clouds, which establish correspondences between the object and the hand.\nThese point clouds are then used for our pre-training policy, where we also\nincorporate object-centric contact maps and hand-arm coordination information,\neffectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics.

In offline-to-online learning, a\nlearner starts with offline data collected from interactions with an unknown\nenvironment in a way that is not under the learner's control. Given this data,\nthe learner begins interacting with the environment, gradually improving its\ninitial strategy as it collects more data to maximize its total reward. The\nlearner in this setting faces a fundamental dilemma: if the policy is deployed\nfor only a short period, a suitable strategy (in a number of senses) is the\nLower Confidence Bound (LCB) algorithm, which is based on pessimism. LCB can\neffectively compete with any policy that is sufficiently \"covered\" by the\noffline data. However, for longer time horizons, a preferred strategy is the\nUpper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, which is based on optimism. Over time,\nUCB converges to the performance of the optimal policy at a rate that is nearly\nthe best possible among all online algorithms. In offline-to-online learning,\nhowever, UCB initially explores excessively, leading to worse short-term\nperformance compared to LCB. This suggests that a learner not in control of how\nlong its policy will be in use should start with LCB for short horizons and\ngradually transition to a UCB-like strategy as more rounds are played. This\narticle explores how and why this transition should occur. Our main result\nshows that our new algorithm performs nearly as well as the better of LCB and\nUCB at any point in time. The core idea behind our algorithm is broadly\napplicable, and we anticipate that our results will extend beyond the\nmulti-armed bandit setting.\n","authors":["Sentenac Flore","Lee Albin","Szepesvari Csaba"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08259v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01969v2","updated":"2025-02-12T09:58:15Z","published":"2024-11-04T10:44:46Z","title":"Toddlers' Active Gaze Behavior Supports Self-Supervised Object Learning","summary":"  Toddlers learn to recognize objects from different viewpoints with almost no\nsupervision.

Recently, adversarial attacks\nhave been proposed in this area, which exposes potential security concerns, and\nmore importantly provides a good tool for model robustness test. Within this\nresearch, transfer-based attack is an important tool as it mimics the\nreal-world scenario where an attacker has no knowledge of the target model, but\nis under-explored in Skeleton-based HAR (S-HAR). Consequently, existing S-HAR\nattacks exhibit weak adversarial transferability and the reason remains largely\nunknown.

To securely manage cloud resources, customers need to configure IAM\nto specify the access control rules for their cloud organizations. However,\nmisconfigured IAM can lead to privilege escalation (PE) attacks, causing\nsignificant economic loss. Third-party cloud security services detect such\nissues using whitebox penetration testing, which requires full access to IAM\nconfigurations. However, since these configurations often contain sensitive\ndata, customers must manually anonymize them to protect their privacy. To\naddress the dual challenges of anonymization and data privacy, we introduce\nTAC, the first greybox penetration testing approach for third-party services to\nefficiently detect IAM PEs. Instead of requiring customers to blindly anonymize\ntheir entire IAM configuration, TAC intelligently interacts with customers by\nquerying only a small fraction of information in the IAM configuration that is\nnecessary for PE detection. To achieve this, TAC integrates two key\ninnovations: (1) a comprehensive IAM modeling approach to detect a wide range\nof IAM PEs using partial information collected from query responses, and (2) a\nquery optimization mechanism leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) to minimize customer inputs. Additionally, to address\nthe scarcity of real-world IAM PE datasets, we introduce IAMVulGen, a\nsynthesizer that generates a large number of diverse IAM PEs that mimic\nreal-world scenarios.

While these prompt-based services (e.g. OpenAI's GPTs)\nplay an important role in many businesses, there has emerged growing concerns\nabout the prompt leakage, which undermines the intellectual properties of these\nservices and causes downstream attacks. In this paper, we analyze the\nunderlying mechanism of prompt leakage, which we refer to as prompt\nmemorization, and develop corresponding defending strategies. By exploring the\nscaling laws in prompt extraction, we analyze key attributes that influence\nprompt extraction, including model sizes, prompt lengths, as well as the types\nof prompts. Then we propose two hypotheses that explain how LLMs expose their\nprompts. The first is attributed to the perplexity, i.e. the familiarity of\nLLMs to texts, whereas the second is based on the straightforward token\ntranslation path in attention matrices. To defend against such threats, we\ninvestigate whether alignments can undermine the extraction of prompts. We find\nthat current LLMs, even those with safety alignments like GPT-4, are highly\nvulnerable to prompt extraction attacks, even under the most straightforward\nuser attacks. Therefore, we put forward several defense strategies with the\ninspiration of our findings, which achieve 83.8\\% and 71.0\\% drop in the prompt\nextraction rate for Llama2-7B and GPT-3.5, respectively.

Recently, test-time adaptation (TTA) has attracted\nattention due to its ability to adapt a pre-trained model to a target domain,\nwithout re-accessing the source domain. However, existing TTA algorithms are\nprimarily designed for attribute shifts in vision tasks, where samples are\nindependent. These methods perform poorly on graph data that experience\nstructure shifts, where node connectivity differs between source and target\ngraphs. We attribute this performance gap to the distinct impact of node\nattribute shifts versus graph structure shifts: the latter significantly\ndegrades the quality of node representations and blurs the boundaries between\ndifferent node categories. To address structure shifts in graphs, we propose\nMatcha, an innovative framework designed for effective and efficient adaptation\nto structure shifts by adjusting the htop-aggregation parameters in GNNs. To\nenhance the representation quality, we design a prediction-informed clustering\nloss to encourage the formation of distinct clusters for different node\ncategories. Additionally, Matcha seamlessly integrates with existing TTA\nalgorithms, allowing it to handle attribute shifts effectively while improving\noverall performance under combined structure and attribute shifts.

In this work,\nwe identify the sensitivity of the model to token-wise random perturbations in\nthe input as a unified metric which explains the inductive bias of transformers\nacross different data modalities and distinguishes them from other\narchitectures. We show that transformers have lower sensitivity than MLPs,\nCNNs, ConvMixers and LSTMs, across both vision and language tasks. We also show\nthat this low-sensitivity bias has important implications: i) lower sensitivity\ncorrelates with improved robustness; it can also be used as an efficient\nintervention to further improve the robustness of transformers; ii) it\ncorresponds to flatter minima in the loss landscape; and iii) it can serve as a\nprogress measure for grokking.

Choice Independence in Using Multilingual LLMs for\n  Persuasive Co-Writing Tasks in Different Languages","summary":"  Recent advances in generative AI have precipitated a proliferation of novel\nwriting assistants. These systems typically rely on multilingual large language\nmodels (LLMs), providing globalized workers the ability to revise or create\ndiverse forms of content in different languages.

Current content moderation systems, which primarily rely on input\nprompt filtering, have proven insufficient, with techniques like Best-of-N\n(BoN) jailbreaking achieving success rates of 80% or more against popular LLMs.\nIn this paper, we introduce Flexible LLM-Assisted Moderation Engine (FLAME): a\nnew approach that shifts the focus from input filtering to output moderation.\nUnlike traditional circuit-breaking methods that analyze user queries, FLAME\nevaluates model responses, offering several key advantages: (1) computational\nefficiency in both training and inference, (2) enhanced resistance to BoN\njailbreaking attacks, and (3) flexibility in defining and updating safety\ncriteria through customizable topic filtering. Our experiments demonstrate that\nFLAME significantly outperforms current moderation systems. For example, FLAME\nreduces attack success rate in GPT-4o-mini and DeepSeek-v3 by a factor of ~9,\nwhile maintaining low computational overhead.

To earn human trust, LLMs must be\nwell calibrated such that they can accurately assess and communicate the\nlikelihood of their predictions being correct. Whereas recent work has focused\non LLMs' internal confidence, less is understood about how effectively they\nconvey uncertainty to users. Here we explore the calibration gap, which refers\nto the difference between human confidence in LLM-generated answers and the\nmodels' actual confidence, and the discrimination gap, which reflects how well\nhumans and models can distinguish between correct and incorrect answers. Our\nexperiments with multiple-choice and short-answer questions reveal that users\ntend to overestimate the accuracy of LLM responses when provided with default\nexplanations.

There have been many works that attempt to reduce\nthe extent of hallucination. These efforts have mostly been empirical so far,\nwhich cannot answer the fundamental question whether it can be completely\neliminated. In this paper, we formalize the problem and show that it is\nimpossible to eliminate hallucination in LLMs. Specifically, we define a formal\nworld where hallucination is defined as inconsistencies between a computable\nLLM and a computable ground truth function.

We perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nand further reinforcement learning (RL) on both success and failure\ntrajectories with a novel reward design considering code explanation and\nrefinement quality.

Multi-head\nLatent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the\nkey-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be\ncached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to\ntraditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA\nemploys an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional\ncomputation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated\nefficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers\nstill rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to\nadopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA\nwhile maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold.\nTo encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce TransMLA, a post-training method\nthat converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen,\nMixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo\nadditional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache\nsize.

Choice Independence in Using Multilingual LLMs for\n  Persuasive Co-Writing Tasks in Different Languages","summary":"  Recent advances in generative AI have precipitated a proliferation of novel\nwriting assistants.

Given their potential impact, it is paramount to\nsystematically test their behaviour and potential for failure. This is a\ncomplex task due to the oracle problem and the high cost of manual labelling\nnecessary to build ground truth keypoints. This problem is exacerbated by the\nfact that different applications require systems to focus on different subjects\n(e.g., human versus animal) or landmarks (e.g., only extremities versus whole\nbody and face), which makes labelled test data rarely reusable. To combat these\nproblems we propose MET-POSE, a metamorphic testing framework for pose\nestimation systems that bypasses the need for manual annotation while assessing\nthe performance of these systems under different circumstances. MET-POSE thus\nallows users of pose estimation systems to assess the systems in conditions\nthat more closely relate to their application without having to label an ad-hoc\ntest dataset or rely only on available datasets, which may not be adapted to\ntheir application domain. While we define MET-POSE in general terms, we also\npresent a non-exhaustive list of metamorphic rules that represent common\nchallenges in computer vision applications, as well as a specific way to\nevaluate these rules. We then experimentally show the effectiveness of MET-POSE\nby applying it to Mediapipe Holistic, a state of the art human pose estimation\nsystem, with the FLIC and PHOENIX datasets. With these experiments, we outline\nnumerous ways in which the outputs of MET-POSE can uncover faults in pose\nestimation systems at a similar or higher rate than classic testing using hand\nlabelled data, and show that users can tailor the rule set they use to the\nfaults and level of accuracy relevant to their application.\n","authors":["Matias Duran","Thomas Laurent","Ellen Rushe","Anthony Ventresque"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09460v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted for publication at 2025 IEEE Conference on Software Testing,\n  Verification and Validation (ICST)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09443v1","updated":"2025-02-13T16:12:17Z","published":"2025-02-13T16:12:17Z","title":"Relational Conformal Prediction for Correlated Time Series","summary":"  We address the problem of uncertainty quantification in time series\nforecasting by exploiting observations at correlated sequences.

For example, to control the thrust of a\nquad-copter propeller the controller modulates its rotation rate, relying on a\nstraightforward mapping between the input rotation rate and the resulting\nthrust. This mapping can be inverted to determine the rotation rate needed to\ngenerate a desired thrust. However, in complex systems, such as flapping-wing\nrobots where intricate fluid motions are involved, mapping inputs (wing\nkinematics) to outcomes (aerodynamic forces) is nontrivial and inverting this\nmapping for real-time control is computationally impractical. Here, we report a\nmachine-learning solution for the inverse mapping of a flapping-wing system\nbased on data from an experimental system we have developed. Our model learns\nthe input wing motion required to generate a desired aerodynamic force outcome.\nWe used a sequence-to-sequence model tailored for time-series data and\naugmented it with a novel adaptive-spectrum layer that implements\nrepresentation learning in the frequency domain. To train our model, we\ndeveloped a flapping wing system that simultaneously measures the wing's\naerodynamic force and its 3D motion using high-speed cameras. We demonstrate\nthe performance of our system on an additional open-source dataset of a\nflapping wing in a different flow regime. Results show superior performance\ncompared with more complex state-of-the-art transformer-based models, with 11%\nimprovement on the test datasets median loss. Moreover, our model shows\nsuperior inference time, making it practical for onboard robotic control.

Specifically, our\nmethod tackles this task within an auto-encoding framework, which encodes\nlow-quality conformations by the proposed WGFormer and decodes corresponding\nground-state conformations by an MLP. The architecture of WGFormer corresponds\nto Wasserstein gradient flows -- it optimizes molecular conformations by\nminimizing an energy function defined on the latent mixture models of atoms,\nthereby significantly improving performance and interpretability. Extensive\nexperiments show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\ncompetitors, providing a new and insightful paradigm to predict molecular\nground-state conformation.\n","authors":["Fanmeng Wang","Minjie Cheng","Hongteng Xu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09795v4.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09271v1","updated":"2025-02-13T12:33:39Z","published":"2025-02-13T12:33:39Z","title":"LiSA: Leveraging Link Recommender to Attack Graph Neural Networks via\n  Subgraph Injection","summary":"  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in\nmodeling data with graph structures, yet recent research reveals their\nsusceptibility to adversarial attacks.

Existing generalist graph models have\nachieved remarkable success in different graph tasks but struggle to generalize\nto the GAD task. This limitation arises from their difficulty in learning\ngeneralized knowledge for capturing the inherently infrequent, irregular and\nheterogeneous abnormality patterns in graphs from different domains. To address\nthis challenge, we propose AnomalyGFM, a GAD-oriented graph foundation model\nthat supports zero-shot inference and few-shot prompt tuning for GAD in diverse\ngraph datasets. One key insight is that graph-agnostic representations for\nnormal and abnormal classes are required to support effective zero/few-shot GAD\nacross different graphs. Motivated by this, AnomalyGFM is pre-trained to align\ndata-independent, learnable normal and abnormal class prototypes with node\nrepresentation residuals (i.e., representation deviation of a node from its\nneighbors). The residual features essentially project the node information into\na unified feature space where we can effectively measure the abnormality of\nnodes from different graphs in a consistent way. This provides a driving force\nfor the learning of graph-agnostic, discriminative prototypes for the normal\nand abnormal classes, which can be used to enable zero-shot GAD on new graphs,\nincluding very large-scale graphs. If there are few-shot labeled normal nodes\navailable in the new graphs, AnomalyGFM can further support prompt tuning to\nleverage these nodes for better adaptation.

However, if the\ncontents of a file are confidential then the length of a compressed file might\nleak confidential information about the content of the file itself. Encrypting\na compressed file does not eliminate this leakage as data encryption schemes\nare only designed to hide the content of confidential message instead of the\nlength of the message. In our proposed Differentially Private\nCompress-Then-Encrypt framework, we add a random positive amount of padding to\nthe compressed file to ensure that any leakage satisfies the rigorous privacy\nguarantee of $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy. The amount of padding\nthat needs to be added depends on the sensitivity of the compression scheme to\nsmall changes in the input, i.e., to what degree can changing a single\ncharacter of the input message impact the length of the compressed file. While\nsome popular compression schemes are highly sensitive to small changes in the\ninput, we argue that effective data compression schemes do not necessarily have\nhigh sensitivity.

While these new methods\ncannot certify whether a model is safe from MIA, they provide practitioners\nwith a means to significantly reduce the number of models that need to undergo\nexpensive MIA assessment through a hierarchical filtering approach.\n  More specifically, it is shown that the rank order of disclosure risk for\ndifferent hyperparameter combinations remains consistent across datasets,\nenabling the development of simple, human-interpretable rules for identifying\nrelatively high-risk models before training. While this ante-hoc analysis\ncannot determine absolute safety since this also depends on the specific\ndataset, it allows the elimination of unnecessarily risky configurations during\nhyperparameter tuning. Additionally, computationally inexpensive structural\nmetrics serve as indicators of MIA vulnerability, providing a second filtering\nstage to identify risky models after training but before conducting expensive\nattacks. Empirical results show that hyperparameter-based risk prediction rules\ncan achieve high accuracy in predicting the most at risk combinations of\nhyperparameters across different tree-based model types, while requiring no\nmodel training. Moreover, target model accuracy is not seen to correlate with\nprivacy risk, suggesting opportunities to optimise model configurations for\nboth performance and privacy.\n","authors":["Richard J.

Traditional anomaly\ndetection methods struggle to effectively differentiate APT-related activities\nfrom benign processes, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios.\nThis paper introduces APT-LLM, a novel embedding-based anomaly detection\nframework that integrates large language models (LLMs) -- BERT, ALBERT,\nDistilBERT, and RoBERTa -- with autoencoder architectures to detect APTs.\nUnlike prior approaches, which rely on manually engineered features or\nconventional anomaly detection models, APT-LLM leverages LLMs to encode\nprocess-action provenance traces into semantically rich embeddings, capturing\nnuanced behavioral patterns. These embeddings are analyzed using three\nautoencoder architectures -- Baseline Autoencoder (AE), Variational Autoencoder\n(VAE), and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) -- to model normal process behavior and\nidentify anomalies. The best-performing model is selected for comparison\nagainst traditional methods.

Traditional Crash Fault Tolerant\n(CFT) protocols, which assume a fail-stop model, are inadequate for untrusted\ncloud environments where adversaries or software bugs can cause Byzantine\nbehavior. Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols address these threats but\nface significant performance, resource overheads, and scalability challenges.\nThis paper introduces Recipe, a novel approach to transforming CFT protocols to\noperate securely in Byzantine settings without altering their core logic.\nRecipe rethinks CFT protocols in the context of modern cloud hardware,\nincluding many-core servers, RDMA-capable networks, and Trusted Execution\nEnvironments (TEEs). The approach leverages these advancements to enhance the\nsecurity and performance of replication protocols in untrusted cloud\nenvironments. Recipe implements two practical security mechanisms, i.e.,\ntransferable authentication and non-equivocation, using TEEs and\nhigh-performance networking stacks (e.g., RDMA, DPDK). These mechanisms ensure\nthat any CFT protocol can be transformed into a BFT protocol, guaranteeing\nauthenticity and non-equivocation. The Recipe protocol consists of five key\ncomponents: transferable authentication, initialization, normal operation, view\nchange, and recovery phases. The protocol's correctness is formally verified\nusing Tamarin, a symbolic model checker. Recipe is implemented as a library and\napplied to transform four widely used CFT protocols-Raft, Chain Replication,\nABD, and AllConcur-into Byzantine settings. The results demonstrate up to 24x\nhigher throughput compared to PBFT and 5.9x better performance than\nstate-of-the-art BFT protocols. Additionally, Recipe requires fewer replicas\nand offers confidentiality, a feature absent in traditional BFT protocols.\n","authors":["Dimitra Giantsidi","Emmanouil Giortamis","Julian Pritzi","Maurice Bailleu","Manos Kapritsos","Pramod Bhatotia"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09251v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09225v1","updated":"2025-02-13T11:51:37Z","published":"2025-02-13T11:51:37Z","title":"A Coq Formalization of Unification Modulo Exclusive-Or","summary":"  Equational Unification is a critical problem in many areas such as automated\ntheorem proving and security protocol analysis.

Privacy research is conducted on various sub-fields,\nincluding Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer\nNetworks. Within each field, privacy has its own formulation. Though pioneering\nworks on attacks and defenses reveal sensitive privacy issues, they are\nnarrowly trapped and cannot fully cover people's actual privacy concerns.\nConsequently, the research on general and human-centric privacy research\nremains rather unexplored. In this paper, we formulate the privacy issue as a\nreasoning problem rather than simple pattern matching. We ground on the\nContextual Integrity (CI) theory which posits that people's perceptions of\nprivacy are highly correlated with the corresponding social context. Based on\nsuch an assumption, we develop the first comprehensive checklist that covers\nsocial identities, private attributes, and existing privacy regulations.

Roughly speaking, this owes itself to\nthe fact that non-realizable distributions $\\mathcal{D}$ are simply more\ndifficult to learn than realizable distributions -- even when one discounts a\nlearner's error by $\\mathrm{err}(h^*_{\\mathcal{D}})$, the error of the best\nhypothesis in $\\mathcal{H}$ for $\\mathcal{D}$. Thus, optimal agnostic learners\nare permitted to incur excess error on (easier-to-learn) distributions\n$\\mathcal{D}$ for which $\\tau = \\mathrm{err}(h^*_{\\mathcal{D}})$ is small.\n  Recent work of Hanneke, Larsen, and Zhivotovskiy (FOCS `24) addresses this\nshortcoming by including $\\tau$ itself as a parameter in the agnostic error\nterm. In this more fine-grained model, they demonstrate tightness of the error\nlower bound $\\tau + \\Omega \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau (d + \\log(1 / \\delta))}{m}} +\n\\frac{d + \\log(1 / \\delta)}{m} \\right)$ in a regime where $\\tau > d/m$, and\nleave open the question of whether there may be a higher lower bound when $\\tau\n\\approx d/m$, with $d$ denoting $\\mathrm{VC}(\\mathcal{H})$.

Further, our learner is computationally\nefficient and is based upon careful aggregations of ERM classifiers, making\nprogress on two other questions of Hanneke, Larsen, and Zhivotovskiy (FOCS\n`24).

This article\npresents two new complementary approaches for efficiently identifying\nvulnerable tree-based models: an ante-hoc analysis of hyperparameter choices\nand a post-hoc examination of trained model structure. While these new methods\ncannot certify whether a model is safe from MIA, they provide practitioners\nwith a means to significantly reduce the number of models that need to undergo\nexpensive MIA assessment through a hierarchical filtering approach.\n  More specifically, it is shown that the rank order of disclosure risk for\ndifferent hyperparameter combinations remains consistent across datasets,\nenabling the development of simple, human-interpretable rules for identifying\nrelatively high-risk models before training.

In\nthis paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B\nparameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to\nthose of human experts. We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel\nframework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to\nrefine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as\nstring normalization, for each individual example at scale. Experimental\nresults show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either\noriginal data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2%\nacross various downstream benchmarks. Its effectiveness spans various model\nsizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, FineWeb,\nFineWeb-Edu, and DCLM. Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in\ndomain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models\ntrained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based\nmethods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for\nLlama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable\nto models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens.

Current approaches\nprovide LLMs with text inputs, candidate labels, and additional side\ninformation (e.g., descriptions) to classify texts. However, their\neffectiveness is hindered by the increased input size and the noise introduced\nthrough side information processing. To address these limitations, we propose a\ngraph-based online retrieval-augmented generation framework, namely GORAG, for\ndynamic few-shot text classification. Rather than treating each input\nindependently, GORAG constructs and maintains a weighted graph by extracting\nside information across all target texts. In this graph, text keywords and\nlabels are represented as nodes, with edges indicating the correlations between\nthem. To model these correlations, GORAG employs an edge weighting mechanism to\nprioritize the importance and reliability of extracted information and\ndynamically retrieves relevant context using a minimum-cost spanning tree\ntailored for each text input.

As autoregressive large language models (LLMs) operate\non high-dimensional representations, we ask whether they are also affected by\nhubness. We first show, theoretically, that the only representation comparison\noperation performed by LLMs, namely that between context and unembedding\nvectors to determine continuation probabilities, is not characterized by the\nconcentration of distances phenomenon that typically causes the appeareance of\nnuisance hubness. We then empirically show that this comparison still leads to\na high degree of hubness, but the hubs in this case do not constitute a\ndisturbance.

In contrast to conventional\nmachine learning (ML) models that are typically optimized over a continuous\nparameter space, VML constrains the parameter space to be human-interpretable\nnatural language. Such a constraint leads to a new perspective of function\napproximation, where an LLM with a text prompt can be viewed as a function\nparameterized by the text prompt. Guided by this perspective, we revisit\nclassical ML problems, such as regression and classification, and find that\nthese problems can be solved by an LLM-parameterized learner and optimizer. The\nmajor advantages of VML include (1) easy encoding of inductive bias: prior\nknowledge about the problem and hypothesis class can be encoded in natural\nlanguage and fed into the LLM-parameterized learner; (2) automatic model class\nselection: the optimizer can automatically select a model class based on data\nand verbalized prior knowledge, and it can update the model class during\ntraining; and (3) interpretable learner updates: the LLM-parameterized\noptimizer can provide explanations for why an update is performed.

To address this\nchallenge, we present three key insights, equivalence voting, constrained\ndecoding, and domain-specific fine-tuning, which significantly enhance LLM\nplanners' capability in handling complex tasks. Equivalence voting ensures\nconsistency by generating and sampling multiple Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)\nformulas from NL commands, grouping equivalent LTL formulas, and selecting the\nmajority group of formulas as the final LTL formula. Constrained decoding then\nuses the generated LTL formula to enforce the autoregressive inference of\nplans, ensuring the generated plans conform to the LTL.

Previous acceleration\nmethods have primarily focused on reducing the number of sampling steps or\nreusing intermediate results, failing to leverage variations across spatial\nregions within the image due to the constraints of convolutional U-Net\nstructures. By harnessing the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in\nhandling variable number of tokens, we introduce RAS, a novel, training-free\nsampling strategy that dynamically assigns different sampling ratios to regions\nwithin an image based on the focus of the DiT model. Our key observation is\nthat during each sampling step, the model concentrates on semantically\nmeaningful regions, and these areas of focus exhibit strong continuity across\nconsecutive steps. Leveraging this insight, RAS updates only the regions\ncurrently in focus, while other regions are updated using cached noise from the\nprevious step. The model's focus is determined based on the output from the\npreceding step, capitalizing on the temporal consistency we observed.

Their learned\nrepresentations often enable state-of-the-art performance for downstream tasks,\nsuch as image classification and segmentation. However, they employ many\nempirically motivated design choices and their training pipelines are highly\ncomplex and unstable -- many hyperparameters need to be carefully tuned to\nensure that the representations do not collapse -- which poses considerable\ndifficulty to improving them or adapting them to new domains. In this work, we\nposit that we can remove most such-motivated idiosyncrasies in the pre-training\npipelines, and only need to add an explicit coding rate term in the loss\nfunction to avoid collapse of the representations. As a result, we obtain\nhighly simplified variants of the DINO and DINOv2 which we call SimDINO and\nSimDINOv2, respectively. Remarkably, these simplified models are more robust to\ndifferent design choices, such as network architecture and hyperparameters, and\nthey learn even higher-quality representations, measured by performance on\ndownstream tasks, offering a Pareto improvement over the corresponding DINO and\nDINOv2 models.

Numerous jailbreak attacks have been proposed to\nassess the security defense of LLMs. Current jailbreak attacks mainly rely on\nscenario camouflage, prompt obfuscation, prompt optimization, and prompt\niterative optimization to conceal malicious prompts. In particular, sequential\nprompt chains in a single query can lead LLMs to focus on certain prompts while\nignoring others, facilitating context manipulation. This paper introduces\nSequentialBreak, a novel jailbreak attack that exploits this vulnerability. We\ndiscuss several scenarios, not limited to examples like Question Bank, Dialog\nCompletion, and Game Environment, where the harmful prompt is embedded within\nbenign ones that can fool LLMs into generating harmful responses. The distinct\nnarrative structures of these scenarios show that SequentialBreak is flexible\nenough to adapt to various prompt formats beyond those discussed. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that SequentialBreak uses only a single query to\nachieve a substantial gain of attack success rate over existing baselines\nagainst both open-source and closed-source models.

Numerous jailbreak attacks have been proposed to\nassess the security defense of LLMs. Current jailbreak attacks mainly rely on\nscenario camouflage, prompt obfuscation, prompt optimization, and prompt\niterative optimization to conceal malicious prompts. In particular, sequential\nprompt chains in a single query can lead LLMs to focus on certain prompts while\nignoring others, facilitating context manipulation.

Among these methods, assertion-based security\nverification has proven to be a promising approach for ensuring that security\nfeatures are effectively met. To this end, some approaches manually define\nsecurity assertions for processor designs; however, these manual methods\nrequire significant time, cost, and human expertise.

Inspired by the success of multi-level fully sparse convolutional\narchitecture in 3D object detection, we aim to build a new 3D visual grounding\nframework following this technical route. However, as in 3D visual grounding\ntask the 3D scene representation should be deeply interacted with text\nfeatures, sparse convolution-based architecture is inefficient for this\ninteraction due to the large amount of voxel features. To this end, we propose\ntext-guided pruning (TGP) and completion-based addition (CBA) to deeply fuse 3D\nscene representation and text features in an efficient way by gradual region\npruning and target completion. Specifically, TGP iteratively sparsifies the 3D\nscene representation and thus efficiently interacts the voxel features with\ntext features by cross-attention. To mitigate the affect of pruning on delicate\ngeometric information, CBA adaptively fixes the over-pruned region by voxel\ncompletion with negligible computational overhead.

In this paper, we study the ability of Transformers to learn\npseudo-random number sequences from linear congruential generators (LCGs),\ndefined by the recurrence relation $x_{t+1} = a x_t + c \\;\\mathrm{mod}\\; m$.\nOur analysis reveals that with sufficient architectural capacity and training\ndata variety, Transformers can perform in-context prediction of LCG sequences\nwith unseen moduli ($m$) and parameters ($a,c$). Through analysis of embedding\nlayers and attention patterns, we uncover how Transformers develop algorithmic\nstructures to learn these sequences in two scenarios of increasing complexity.\nFirst, we analyze how Transformers learn LCG sequences with unseen ($a, c$) but\nfixed modulus, and we demonstrate successful learning up to $m = 2^{32}$. Our\nanalysis reveals that models learn to factorize the modulus and utilize\ndigit-wise number representations to make sequential predictions. In the\nsecond, more challenging scenario of unseen moduli, we show that Transformers\ncan generalize to unseen moduli up to $m_{\\text{test}} = 2^{16}$. In this case,\nthe model employs a two-step strategy: first estimating the unknown modulus\nfrom the context, then utilizing prime factorizations to generate predictions.\nFor this task, we observe a sharp transition in the accuracy at a critical\ndepth $=3$.

Further, we show that as we scale\ntest-time compute (measured as the output token length) and training data,\nsuboptimality of VF methods scales poorly compared to VB when the base\npre-trained LLM presents a heterogeneous distribution over correct solution\ntraces (e.g., different lengths, styles, etc.) and admits a non-sharp\ndistribution over rewards on traces sampled from it. We formalize this\ncondition using anti-concentration [Erd\\H{o}s, 1945]. This implies a stronger\nresult that VB methods scale better asymptotically, with the performance gap\nbetween VB and VF methods widening as test-time budget grows. We corroborate\nour theory empirically on both didactic and math reasoning problems with\n3/8/32B-sized pre-trained LLMs, where we find verification is crucial for\nscaling test-time compute.\n","authors":["Amrith Setlur","Nived Rajaraman","Sergey Levine","Aviral Kumar"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12118v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09782v2","updated":"2025-02-17T18:42:31Z","published":"2025-02-13T21:33:57Z","title":"Improving Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks on Keyboards Using Transformers\n  and Large Language Models","summary":"  The increasing prevalence of microphones in everyday devices and the growing\nreliance on online services have amplified the risk of acoustic side-channel\nattacks (ASCAs) targeting keyboards.

However, as\nthe scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer\nfrom accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational\nresources but also interferes with effective reasoning. To address this issue,\nwe observe that complex reasoning progress is often achieved by solving a\nsequence of independent subquestions, each being self-contained and verifiable.\nThese subquestions are essentially atomic questions, relying primarily on their\ncurrent state rather than accumulated history, similar to the memoryless\ntransitions in a Markov process. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of\nThoughts (AoT), where each state transition in the reasoning process consists\nof decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic\ngraph and contracting its subquestions, forming a new atomic question state.\nThis iterative decomposition-contraction process continues until reaching\ndirectly solvable atomic questions, naturally realizing Markov transitions\nbetween question states. Furthermore, these atomic questions can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling AoT to serve as a\nplug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities.

This paper presents an overview of the first SCICAP\nChallenge and details the performance of various models on its data, capturing\na snapshot of the fields state. We found that professional editors\noverwhelmingly preferred figure captions generated by GPT-4V over those from\nall other models and even the original captions written by authors. Following\nthis key finding, we conducted detailed analyses to answer this question: Have\nadvanced LMMs solved the task of generating captions for scientific figures?\n","authors":["Ting-Yao E.

These triplets (task intent, positive response, and negative\nresponse) are then utilized as training data to optimize a reward model capable\nof scoring action trajectories. The effectiveness and generalizability of our\nframework are demonstrated through evaluations conducted on different agent\nbenchmarks. In conclusion, our proposed framework represents a significant\nadvancement in enhancing LLM agents' decision-making capabilities. By\nautomating the learning of reward models, we overcome the challenges of data\nscarcity and API limitations, potentially revolutionizing the application of\nLLMs in complex and interactive environments.

We\nargue that this perspective applies to many modern applications of machine\nlearning in social contexts, and advocate for its adoption. Rather than\ndisposing of prediction, we aim to leverage this forte of machine learning for\npromoting social welfare.

To address this issue, we\npropose GGatrieval (Fine-\\textbf{G}rained \\textbf{G}rounded \\textbf{A}lignment\nRe\\textbf{trieval} for verifiable generation), which leverages an LLM to\ndynamically update queries and filter high-quality, reliable retrieval\ndocuments. Specifically, we parse the user query into its syntactic components\nand perform fine-grained grounded alignment with the retrieved documents. For\nquery components that cannot be individually aligned, we propose a dynamic\nsemantic compensation mechanism that iteratively refines and rewrites the query\nwhile continuously updating the retrieval results. This iterative process\ncontinues until the retrieved documents sufficiently support the query's\nresponse. Our approach introduces a novel criterion for filtering retrieved\ndocuments, closely emulating human strategies for acquiring targeted\ninformation. This ensures that the retrieved content effectively supports and\nverifies the generated outputs. On the ALCE benchmark, our method significantly\nsurpasses a wide range of baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n","authors":["Bingyu Wan","Fuxi Zhang","Zhongpeng Qi","Jiayi Ding","Jijun Li","Baoshi Fan","Yijia Zhang","Jun Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11770v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11763v1","updated":"2025-02-17T12:55:41Z","published":"2025-02-17T12:55:41Z","title":"Lightweight Deepfake Detection Based on Multi-Feature Fusion","summary":"  Deepfake technology utilizes deep learning based face manipulation techniques\nto seamlessly replace faces in videos creating highly realistic but\nartificially generated content.

To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving this challenge, we\nintroduce BaxBench, a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of 392 tasks for\nthe generation of backend applications.

To ensure robust DRAM operation,\nstate-of-the-art mitigation mechanisms restore the charge in potential victim\nrows (i.e., they perform preventive refresh or charge restoration). With newer\nDRAM chip generations, these mechanisms perform preventive refresh more\naggressively and cause larger performance, energy, or area overheads.\nTherefore, it is essential to develop a better understanding and in-depth\ninsights into the preventive refresh to secure real DRAM chips at low cost. In\nthis paper, our goal is to mitigate RowHammer at low cost by understanding the\nimpact of reduced preventive refresh latency on RowHammer. To this end, we\npresent the first rigorous experimental study on the interactions between\nrefresh latency and RowHammer characteristics in real DRAM chips. Our\nexperimental characterization using 388 real DDR4 DRAM chips from three major\nmanufacturers demonstrates that a preventive refresh latency can be\nsignificantly reduced (by 64%). To investigate the impact of reduced preventive\nrefresh latency on system performance and energy efficiency, we reduce the\npreventive refresh latency and adjust the aggressiveness of existing RowHammer\nsolutions by developing a new mechanism, Partial Charge Restoration for\nAggressive Mitigation (PaCRAM). Our results show that PaCRAM reduces the\nperformance and energy overheads induced by five state-of-the-art RowHammer\nmitigation mechanisms with small additional area overhead.

Most leading ventral stream models are derived by optimizing\nnetworks for object categorization, which seems to imply that the ventral\nstream is also derived under such an objective. Here, we explore an alternative\nhypothesis: Might the ventral stream be optimized for estimating spatial\nlatents? And a closely related question: How different -- if at all -- are\nrepresentations learned from spatial latent estimation compared to\ncategorization? To ask these questions, we leveraged synthetic image datasets\ngenerated by a 3D graphic engine and trained convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) to estimate different combinations of spatial and category latents. We\nfound that models trained to estimate just a few spatial latents achieve neural\nalignment scores comparable to those trained on hundreds of categories, and the\nspatial latent performance of models strongly correlates with their neural\nalignment. Spatial latent and category-trained models have very similar -- but\nnot identical -- internal representations, especially in their early and middle\nlayers. We provide evidence that this convergence is partly driven by\nnon-target latent variability in the training data, which facilitates the\nimplicit learning of representations of those non-target latents. Taken\ntogether, these results suggest that many training objectives, such as spatial\nlatents, can lead to similar models aligned neurally with the ventral stream.\nThus, one should not assume that the ventral stream is optimized for object\ncategorization only.

In this paper, we explore a different\napproach by reframing vulnerability detection as one of anomaly detection.\nSince the vast majority of code does not contain vulnerabilities and LLMs are\ntrained on massive amounts of such code, vulnerable code can be viewed as an\nanomaly from the LLM's predicted code distribution, freeing the model from the\nneed for labelled data to provide a learnable representation of vulnerable\ncode.

There are largely two approaches: first,\ndistilling successful search or thinking traces; and second, using verification\n(e.g., 0/1 outcome rewards, reward models, or verifiers) to guide reinforcement\nlearning (RL) and search algorithms. In this paper, we prove that finetuning\nLLMs with verifier-based (VB) methods based on RL or search is far superior to\nverifier-free (VF) approaches based on distilling or cloning search traces,\ngiven a fixed amount of compute/data budget. Further, we show that as we scale\ntest-time compute (measured as the output token length) and training data,\nsuboptimality of VF methods scales poorly compared to VB when the base\npre-trained LLM presents a heterogeneous distribution over correct solution\ntraces (e.g., different lengths, styles, etc.) and admits a non-sharp\ndistribution over rewards on traces sampled from it. We formalize this\ncondition using anti-concentration [Erd\\H{o}s, 1945]. This implies a stronger\nresult that VB methods scale better asymptotically, with the performance gap\nbetween VB and VF methods widening as test-time budget grows.

With the\nrecent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an increasing\ninterest in exploring their capabilities in causal reasoning and their\npotential use to hypothesize causal graphs. These tasks necessitate the LLMs to\nencode the causal graph effectively for subsequent downstream tasks. In this\npaper, we introduce CausalGraph2LLM, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over\n700k queries across diverse causal graph settings to evaluate the causal\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs. We categorize the causal queries into two\ntypes: graph-level and node-level queries. We benchmark both open-sourced and\npropriety models for our study. Our findings reveal that while LLMs show\npromise in this domain, they are highly sensitive to the encoding used. Even\ncapable models like GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 exhibit sensitivity to encoding, with\ndeviations of about $60\\%$. We further demonstrate this sensitivity for\ndownstream causal intervention tasks.

Existing approaches often employ multi-stage generation procedures,\nresulting in cumbersome training and inference pipelines. In this paper, we\npropose SongGen, a fully open-source, single-stage auto-regressive transformer\ndesigned for controllable song generation. The proposed model facilitates\nfine-grained control over diverse musical attributes, including lyrics and\ntextual descriptions of instrumentation, genre, mood, and timbre, while also\noffering an optional three-second reference clip for voice cloning. Within a\nunified auto-regressive framework, SongGen supports two output modes: mixed\nmode, which generates a mixture of vocals and accompaniment directly, and\ndual-track mode, which synthesizes them separately for greater flexibility in\ndownstream applications. We explore diverse token pattern strategies for each\nmode, leading to notable improvements and valuable insights.

For example, an AI may assist doctors in determining which diagnostic\ntests to run, but the doctor ultimately makes the diagnosis. This paper studies\nsuch AI-assisted decision-making settings, where the human learns through\nrepeated interactions with the algorithm. In our framework, the algorithm --\ndesigned to maximize decision accuracy according to its own model -- determines\nwhich features the human can consider. The human then makes a prediction based\non their own less accurate model. We observe that the discrepancy between the\nalgorithm's model and the human's model creates a fundamental tradeoff. Should\nthe algorithm prioritize recommending more informative features, encouraging\nthe human to recognize their importance, even if it results in less accurate\npredictions in the short term until learning occurs? Or is it preferable to\nforgo educating the human and instead select features that align more closely\nwith their existing understanding, minimizing the immediate cost of learning?\nThis tradeoff is shaped by the algorithm's time-discounted objective and the\nhuman's learning ability.

As the algorithm\nbecomes more \"patient\" or the human's learning improves, the algorithm\nincreasingly selects more informative features, enhancing both prediction\naccuracy and the human's understanding.

Our approach directly\ntransforms pre-trained language models into B-cos LMs by combining B-cos\nconversion and task fine-tuning, improving efficiency compared to previous\nB-cos methods. Our automatic and human evaluation results demonstrate that\nB-cos LMs produce more faithful and human interpretable explanations than post\nhoc methods, while maintaining task performance comparable to conventional\nfine-tuning. Our in-depth analysis explores how B-cos LMs differ from\nconventionally fine-tuned models in their learning processes and explanation\npatterns. Finally, we provide practical guidelines for effectively building\nB-cos LMs based on our findings.

Recent\ntheory has shown that a rollout algorithm with a stable base policy produces a\nnear-optimal stable policy. In the routing setting, a policy is stable if its\nexecution keeps the number of outstanding requests uniformly bounded over time.\nAlthough, rollout-based approaches are well-suited for learning cooperative\nmultiagent policies with considerations for future demand, applying such\nmethods to a large urban environment can be computationally expensive due to\nthe large number of taxis required for stability. In this paper, we aim to\naddress the computational bottleneck of multiagent rollout by proposing an\napproximate multiagent rollout-based two phase algorithm that reduces\ncomputational costs, while still achieving a stable near-optimal policy. Our\napproach partitions the graph into sectors based on the predicted demand and\nthe maximum number of taxis that can run sequentially given the user's\ncomputational resources. The algorithm then applies instantaneous assignment\n(IA) for re-balancing taxis across sectors and a sector-wide multiagent rollout\nalgorithm that is executed in parallel for each sector. We provide two main\ntheoretical results: 1) characterize the number of taxis $m$ that is sufficient\nfor IA to be stable; 2) derive a necessary condition on $m$ to maintain\nstability for IA as time goes to infinity. Our numerical results show that our\napproach achieves stability for an $m$ that satisfies the theoretical\nconditions. We also empirically demonstrate that our proposed two phase\nalgorithm has equivalent performance to the one-at-a-time rollout over the\nentire map, but with significantly lower runtimes.\n","authors":["Daniel Garces","Sushmita Bhattacharya","Dimitri Bertsekas","Stephanie Gil"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01534v4.pdf","comment":"12 pages, 5 figures, 1 lemma, and 2 theorems"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12985v1","updated":"2025-02-18T16:08:47Z","published":"2025-02-18T16:08:47Z","title":"PartSDF: Part-Based Implicit Neural Representation for Composite 3D\n  Shape Parametrization and Optimization","summary":"  Accurate 3D shape representation is essential in engineering applications\nsuch as design, optimization, and simulation.

However, a well-informed prior distribution can provide\nvaluable insights beyond the empirical data under the limited data or\nlow-density regions of confidence scores. To fill this gap, this paper proposes\na new method that integrates the prior distribution behind the calibration\ncurve with empirical data to estimate a continuous calibration curve, which is\nrealized by modeling the sampling process of calibration data as a binomial\nprocess and maximizing the likelihood function of the binomial process.

Thus the underlying foundation model should be\neventually replaced by new ones, which leads to repeated cost of fine-tuning\nthese new models. Existing work addresses this problem by inference-time\ntuning, i.e., modifying the output probabilities from the new foundation model\nwith the outputs from the old foundation model and its fine-tuned model, which\ninvolves an additional overhead in inference by the latter two models. In this\npaper, we propose a new fine-tuning principle, Portable Reward Tuning (PRT),\nthat reduces the inference overhead by its nature, based on the reformulation\nof fine-tuning as the reward maximization. Specifically, instead of fine-tuning\nparameters of the foundation models, PRT trains the reward model explicitly\nthrough the same loss function as in fine-tuning. During inference, the reward\nmodel can be used with any foundation model (with the same set of vocabularies\nor labels) through the formulation of reward maximization. Experimental\nresults, covering both vision and language models, demonstrate that the\nPRT-trained model can achieve comparable accuracy to the existing work of\ninference-time tuning, with less inference cost.\n","authors":["Daiki Chijiwa","Taku Hasegawa","Kyosuke Nishida","Kuniko Saito","Susumu Takeuchi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12776v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12769v1","updated":"2025-02-18T11:32:43Z","published":"2025-02-18T11:32:43Z","title":"How Much Do LLMs Hallucinate across Languages? On Multilingual\n  Estimation of LLM Hallucination in the Wild","summary":"  In the age of misinformation, hallucination -- the tendency of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to generate non-factual or unfaithful responses -- represents the\nmain risk for their global utility. Despite LLMs becoming increasingly\nmultilingual, the vast majority of research on detecting and quantifying LLM\nhallucination are (a) English-centric and (b) focus on machine translation (MT)\nand summarization, tasks that are less common ``in the wild'' than open\ninformation seeking. In contrast, we aim to quantify the extent of LLM\nhallucination across languages in knowledge-intensive long-form question\nanswering. To this end, we train a multilingual hallucination detection model\nand conduct a large-scale study across 30 languages and 6 open-source LLM\nfamilies. We start from an English hallucination detection dataset and rely on\nMT to generate (noisy) training data in other languages. We also manually\nannotate gold data for five high-resource languages; we then demonstrate, for\nthese languages, that the estimates of hallucination rates are similar between\nsilver (LLM-generated) and gold test sets, validating the use of silver data\nfor estimating hallucination rates for other languages. For the final rates\nestimation, we build a knowledge-intensive QA dataset for 30 languages with\nLLM-generated prompts and Wikipedia articles as references. We find that, while\nLLMs generate longer responses with more hallucinated tokens for\nhigher-resource languages, there is no correlation between length-normalized\nhallucination rates of languages and their digital representation. Further, we\nfind that smaller LLMs exhibit larger hallucination rates than larger models.\n","authors":["Saad Obaid ul Islam","Anne Lauscher","Goran Glavaš"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12769v1.pdf","comment":"Under Review"}],"Cryptography and Security":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13115v1","updated":"2025-02-18T18:35:24Z","published":"2025-02-18T18:35:24Z","title":"Near-Optimal Private Learning in Linear Contextual Bandits","summary":"  We analyze the problem of private learning in generalized linear contextual\nbandits.

State-of-the-art\nread disturbance mitigations rely on accurate and exhaustive characterization\nof the read disturbance threshold (RDT) (e.g., the number of aggressor row\nactivations needed to induce the first RowHammer or RowPress bitflip) of every\nDRAM row (of which there are millions or billions in a modern system) to\nprevent read disturbance bitflips securely and with low overhead. We\nexperimentally demonstrate for the first time that the RDT of a DRAM row\nsignificantly and unpredictably changes over time. We call this new phenomenon\nvariable read disturbance (VRD). Our experiments using 160 DDR4 chips and 4\nHBM2 chips from three major manufacturers yield two key observations. First, it\nis very unlikely that relatively few RDT measurements can accurately identify\nthe RDT of a DRAM row. The minimum RDT of a DRAM row appears after tens of\nthousands of measurements (e.g., up to 94,467), and the minimum RDT of a DRAM\nrow is 3.5X smaller than the maximum RDT observed for that row. Second, the\nprobability of accurately identifying a row's RDT with a relatively small\nnumber of measurements reduces with increasing chip density or smaller\ntechnology node size. Our empirical results have implications for the security\nguarantees of read disturbance mitigation techniques: if the RDT of a DRAM row\nis not identified accurately, these techniques can easily become insecure. We\ndiscuss and evaluate using a guardband for RDT and error-correcting codes for\nmitigating read disturbance bitflips in the presence of RDTs that change\nunpredictably over time. We conclude that a >10% guardband for the minimum\nobserved RDT combined with SECDED or Chipkill-like SSC error-correcting codes\ncould prevent read disturbance bitflips at the cost of large read disturbance\nmitigation performance overheads (e.g., 45% performance loss for an RDT\nguardband of 50%).\n","authors":["Ataberk Olgun","F.

To remedy this, we propose L2D-CD, a method for gauging the\ncorrectness of expert recommendations and optimally combining them with\ndata-driven causal discovery results. By adapting learning-to-defer (L2D)\nalgorithms for pairwise causal discovery (CD), we learn a deferral function\nthat selects whether to rely on classical causal discovery methods using\nnumerical data or expert recommendations based on textual meta-data. We\nevaluate L2D-CD on the canonical T\\\"ubingen pairs dataset and demonstrate its\nsuperior performance compared to both the causal discovery method and the\nexpert used in isolation. Moreover, our approach identifies domains where the\nexpert's performance is strong or weak. Finally, we outline a strategy for\ngeneralizing this approach to causal discovery on graphs with more than two\nvariables, paving the way for further research in this area.\n","authors":["Oscar Clivio","Divyat Mahajan","Perouz Taslakian","Sara Magliacane","Ioannis Mitliagkas","Valentina Zantedeschi","Alexandre Drouin"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13132v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11687v2","updated":"2025-02-18T18:55:39Z","published":"2024-10-15T15:22:38Z","title":"State-space models can learn in-context by gradient descent","summary":"  Deep state-space models (Deep SSMs) are becoming popular as effective\napproaches to model sequence data.

There are largely two approaches: first,\ndistilling successful search or thinking traces; and second, using verification\n(e.g., 0/1 outcome rewards, reward models, or verifiers) to guide reinforcement\nlearning (RL) and search algorithms. In this paper, we prove that finetuning\nLLMs with verifier-based (VB) methods based on RL or search is far superior to\nverifier-free (VF) approaches based on distilling or cloning search traces,\ngiven a fixed amount of compute/data budget. Further, we show that as we scale\ntest-time compute (measured as the output token length) and training data,\nsuboptimality of VF methods scales poorly compared to VB when the base\npre-trained LLM presents a heterogeneous distribution over correct solution\ntraces (e.g., different lengths, styles, etc.) and admits a non-sharp\ndistribution over rewards on traces sampled from it. We formalize this\ncondition using anti-concentration [Erd\\H{o}s, 1945].

Our diffusion model is a mixture of 3D\nconditioning and 2D denoising U-Net. The approach leverages a 3D block-based\ncompressing module to address spatiotemporal correlations in structured\nscientific data. Then, the reverse diffusion process for 2D spatial data is\nconditioned on the ``slices'' of content latent variables produced by the\ncompressing module. After training, the denoising decoder reconstructs the data\nwith zero noise and content latent variables, and thus it is entirely\ndeterministic. The reconstructed outputs of the CD model are further\npost-processed by our tensor correction and error guarantee steps to control\nand ensure a maximum error distortion, which is an inevitable requirement in\nlossy scientific data compression. Our experiments involving two datasets\ngenerated by climate and chemical combustion simulations show that our\nframework outperforms standard convolutional autoencoders and yields\ncompetitive compression quality with an existing scientific data compression\nalgorithm.\n","authors":["Jaemoon Lee","Xiao Li","Liangji Zhu","Sanjay Ranka","Anand Rangarajan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12951v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12947v1","updated":"2025-02-18T15:30:34Z","published":"2025-02-18T15:30:34Z","title":"Every Expert Matters: Towards Effective Knowledge Distillation for\n  Mixture-of-Experts Language Models","summary":"  With the emergence of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), the efficient scaling of\nmodel size has accelerated the development of large language models in recent\nyears.

The accuracy of\nthese predictions is crucial for evaluating the treatment effect of a policy\nintervention. Subsequent research has therefore focused on estimating SC\nweights. In this study, we highlight a key endogeneity issue in existing\nSCMs-namely, the correlation between the outcomes of untreated units and the\nerror term of the synthetic control, which leads to bias in both counterfactual\noutcome prediction and treatment effect estimation. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel SCM based on density matching, assuming that the outcome\ndensity of the treated unit can be approximated by a weighted mixture of the\njoint density of untreated units. Under this assumption, we estimate SC weights\nby matching the moments of the treated outcomes with the weighted sum of the\nmoments of the untreated outcomes. Our method offers three advantages: first,\nunder the mixture model assumption, our estimator is asymptotically unbiased;\nsecond, this asymptotic unbiasedness reduces the mean squared error in\ncounterfactual predictions; and third, our method provides full densities of\nthe treatment effect rather than just expected values, thereby broadening the\napplicability of SCMs. Finally, we present experimental results that\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\n","authors":["Masahiro Kato","Akari Ohda"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11127v4.pdf","comment":"This study was presented at the Workshop on Counterfactuals in Minds\n  and Machines at the International Conference on Machine Learning in July 2023\n  and at the International Conference on Econometrics and Statistics in August\n  2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12920v1","updated":"2025-02-18T15:01:02Z","published":"2025-02-18T15:01:02Z","title":"Lightweight Online Adaption for Time Series Foundation Model Forecasts","summary":"  Foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a promising approach for time series\nforecasting.

At each iteration, the form\nof the box is adapted during the search through an affine transformation, based\nonly on the point $\\boldsymbol x$ position and on the success or failure in\nimproving the function. The function values are therefore not used directly to\nmodify the search area and to generate the next sample. The entire\ndimensionality is kept (no active subspaces).\n  Despite its extreme simplicity and its use of only stochastic local search,\nsurprisingly the produced results are comparable to and not too far from the\nstate-of-the-art results of high-dimensional versions of BO, although with some\nmore function evaluations.\n  An ablation study and an analysis of probability distribution of directions\n(improving steps and prevailing box orientation) in very large-dimensional\nspaces are conducted to understand more about the behavior of RAS and to assess\nthe relative importance of the algorithmic building blocks for the final\nresults.\n","authors":["Roberto Battiti","Mauro Brunato"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12877v1.pdf","comment":"Submitted to: the 19th Learning and Intelligent Optimization\n  Conference (LION19), June 15-19 2025, Prague, Czech Republic\n  (https://lion19.org/)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12874v1","updated":"2025-02-18T14:05:04Z","published":"2025-02-18T14:05:04Z","title":"Testing for Causal Fairness","summary":"  Causality is widely used in fairness analysis to prevent discrimination on\nsensitive attributes, such as genders in career recruitment and races in crime\nprediction.
